										+ + + + DARKY'S ARMFUL COLLECTION OF UPGRADES + + + +

														Version 1.0

	Currently contains 34 new upgrades.
	Thanks to Aktan and G lander for GREATLY helping out with the code, without them this mod would most likely not be here right now.

													~ ~ ~ CHANGELOG ~ ~ ~

													Version 1.0 [02/02/20]

	• Finally, after a long time of trying and failing its here: Darky's Armful Collection of Upgrades!
	• First created back in August 19, 2018. I've tried to make it work by myself a few times but never could figure out how to actually go about this.
	• A year later I've tried it again, it must be possible to make an Upgrade mod for Cookie Clicker, right?
	• So i sat there, looking through the code once more and testing out a few things until FINALLY i at least managed to make the generic Building Upgrades work except for the Cursor and the mouse.
	• I asked Aktan for help with those two Upgrades as well as for helping me make the Save System work, so you don't have to re-buy every upgrade again everytime you load the mod.
	• Sometime in January we finally got the Save System working as well as the 2 Upgrades! A few finishing touches had to be made to the Save System though apparently.
	• And now finally i can share this mod with everyone, so glad its finally done and out!
	• My main focus is still on my Achievement Package however. I would love to bring in some original upgrades as well (there is one in this mod but currently unavailable to get because it has no function) but for that I would always have to ask either Aktan or G lander for help because making an Upgrade mod is pretty hard, at least for me.
	• Anyway I'm done, now I patiently wait for the next Update to work on new Achievements again.

	Thanks to Aktan, trashboyjet and G lander for helping out with some of the code!
	Some achievements use custom icons: Clicking Achievement icons from Gouchnox, 100lol, iwantdevil, sis, Xalum, Darky (me); "Buildings owned" and "Upgrades purchased" icons recolored in the style of the "300-500 of everything" Achievement icons by Darky (me).

	Enjoy!

													~ ~ ~ CHANGELOG ~ ~ ~

													Version 1.5.2 [01/02/20]

	• Happy New Year, just a month late!
	• This update doesn't add new content, it just changes a few things regarding the ASS.
	• Thanks go out to Aktan and G lander once again.
	• Also the bakery has been baking something for quite a while.
	• It's been long in the baking, a few times it was close to being done but it never quite was.
	• But now it should be ready and you can finally taste the new baked goodies yourself.
	• Here's your coupon code: eFPWvzga

													Version 1.5.1 [30/11/19]

	• Thanks to G lander, this whole mess of a code is less of a whole mess of a code now.
	• Changelog has been updated too, now you can see at what point of time in the past a certain update came out (I'll try to keep track of it from now on)
	• At this point i wanna just quickly say thank you to everyone who has been using my mod so far and supported me, it's really a nice feeling knowing people enjoy and use what you have made. So: Thank you!!

													Version 1.5 [28/09/19]

	• Another Cookie Clicker Update means a new Darky's Achievement Package Update as well!
	• 550 of javascript console Achievement added
	• Cookies from clicking expanded to 100 quattuordecillion
	• Buildings owned expanded to 9,000
	• Upgrades owned expanded to 500
	• Replaced the meow sound effect with another when you load the mod.
	• Replaced "Stop it, it clickles" and "I'm too old for this" icon with the new Iridyum tier and gave it's previous icon over to only "Keep up the click"
	• Changed "Clicking is the new booping" to a different icon
	• Icon credit: "Sike, thats the wrong achievement" by Darky (me); "How about we tap the cookie now" and "Cookie Destroyer" by Gouchnox; "Give it a click" by iwantdevil; "Clicking Frenzy: Our Lord and Saviour" by 100lol; "Hand-made cookies are still the best" by sis; "My strange clicking addiction" by Xalum

													Version 1.4.2 [22/11/18]

	• Apparently the new and better ASS from Aktan wasn't fully functional, it was actually freezing the game for people who are already in late game i guess, so the Package was temporarily not working correctly but now its fixed again.
	• Thanks to steinfg on Reddit for pointing that bad boy of an error out to me!

													Version 1.4.1 [21/11/18]

	• Give it up for Aktan for making a new and better ASS to work with!

													Version 1.4 [21/11/18]

	• Thanks to trashboyjet there's now a new ASS
	• Also thanks to Aktan these new achievements now have their own crates and question marks to distinguish them better from the vanilla ones
	• + new Achievement added but its a secret, shhh.

													Version 1.3.1 [28/10/18]

	• + new Achievements added: Purchase all pastries, maybe cookies, not cookies and plant upgrades
	• minor fixes

													Version 1.3 [20/10/18]

	• 550 of fractal engines Achievement added
	• Buildings owned expanded to 8,000
	• x of everything expanded to 550 (yes)
	• + new Shadow Achievements added: Dashnet reached 10, 25, 50 and 100 heralds
	• changed "halsave" to "darkysave" (because that was causing problems if you used Hal's Mod, oops)

													Version 1.2.ASS [12/08/18]

	• Just added an "Achievement Saving System"
	• Imagine you just recently got that 700 Cursor Achievement and then you ascended, so you're back at 0, right?
	• Then you reload the page and oh no, the mod is gone and with that mod also that achievement, right??
	• Well with this ASS you keep that sweet 700 Cursor Achievement when you load the mod again, hooray!
	• DISCLAIMER: Seems like this thing is broken though, like when you hard-reset and then load the mod again you just get the achievements again even though that shouldn't be possible. Not sure how to fix that, sorry.

													Version 1.2 [12/08/18]

	• + new Achievement added: Purchase the 3 secret prestige upgrades
	• + new Achievements added: Purchase 15, 30 and 60 prestige upgrades
	• + new Achievements added: Purchase all fancy biscuits, all macarons, all popular biscuits and all rich butter cookies
	• + new Achievements added: Reach Level 1 and 5 of every building

	• + new Achievement added: Click the big Cookie 25,000 times
	• + new Shadow Achievement added: Name yourself Darky
	• + new Shadow Achievement added: Click 77,777 golden cookies
	• Changed "Clicker" and "Advanced Clicker"'s icons to the unused stone versions of the mouse upgrades/achievements as well as moved their position next to the mouse achievements
	• Thanks to Aktan again for helping me out with the 15; 30 and 60 prestige upgrades achievements!

													Version 1.1 [08/08/18]

	• Oh look, a new Cookie Clicker Update (2.012). Because of this new Update I have to modify my achievements now too.
	• 600 Cursor Achievement is now at 700, icon also changed to Cherrysilver tier
	• Achievements from farms to chancemakers changed from 500 to 550, icons also changed to Alabascream tier.
	• 100 octillion cookies from clicking achievement's icon changed to a...currently unused tier.
	• Purchase 400 Upgrades
